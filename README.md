Java

This is scheduling application I made for my second Java class, which uses data stored in a SQL database.

The application requires the user to login with correct credentials, will translate the login form based off the user's default language, and will show all appointment times in the user's local time.

This project was the most complicated one I've worked on yet, and has helped me feel confident in my coding aptitude. I look forward to my future challenges!

Disclaimer - I am trying to post my completed projects for the sole purpose of adding them to my portfolio website.

Thank you for your time :)
